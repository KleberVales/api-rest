# api-rest

### 1. Understand the fundamentals of the Web

- What is HTTP (web protocol)
- Main methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH
- Status codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error)
- Structure of a request: URL, headers, body, response

### 2. REST concept

- REST = Representational State Transfer
- Principles:
     - Resources represented by URLs (e.g., /clients/1)
     - Stateless: each request is independent
     - Correct use of HTTP verbs
     - Data format: typically JSON

 ### 3. Tools for practice

 - Postman or Insomnia → for testing APIs
 - curl → command line for HTTP requests

### 4. Complete CRUD

- Create endpoints for Create, Read, Update, Delete.
- Using Spring Data JPA for database persistence (e.g., PostgreSQL).

### 5. Good practices

- Structure URLs clearly (/clients/{id}/orders).
- Use the correct status codes.
- Return standardized error messages.
- Document the API using Swagger/OpenAPI.

### 6. Advanced features

- Authentication and authorization (JWT, OAuth2, Spring Security).
- Pagination and filters in endpoints.
